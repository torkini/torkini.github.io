The cave Hang Son Doong, Translating to English as Mountain River Cave, is the worlds largest cave, located in Vietnam. It's situated close to the Loas-Vietnam border, quite close to the cave that was previously considered the largest in Vietnam, Phong Nha Cave.</p> <p>

</p> <p>It is so large that it has it's own climate and micro-ecosystem. It has clouds and two full forests along with a rapid river that runs the whole way through.</p> <p>

<section class= "introduction"><h2>When?</h2>
</section>
</p> <p><section class= "text">
Son Doong was found in 1991 by a local man, Há»“-Khanh. But the sounds of whistling winds, a rapid river and the steep decline to get in prevented them from exploring further. It wasn't until 2009 when the rest of the world found out about the cave after a group of scientists from the British Cave Research Association stumbled upon it after an expedition through the Phong Nha cave.</p> <p>

<section class= "introduction"><h2>How?</h2>
</section>
    </p> <p>
<section class= "text">
The cave was created by the enormous river beneath it eroding away the limestone. Over thousands of millions of years it eroded away the limestone to create chambers of incomprehensible size. The Son Doong cave is also known for having excessively large stalecmites over 70 feet in height and cave pearls the size of baseballs.
