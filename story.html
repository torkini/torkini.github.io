        I didn't realize I had superpowers until I punched Macy Lynch and broke her arm.

It wasn't that bad, only a slight fracture, but I still had to pay bill after bill for her to get it fixed. I had to get a job at the local stationary store making about four dollars an hour (is that legal??) all to fix the arm of a girl who I could care less about.

The government contacted me about a week into my gruelling work. They wanted to know whether I had been exhibiting signs of other powers and whether I was going to use them for good. I hung up on them. In our city, we have two groups of Powers, the X and the Exiles. Cute, I know. The X fight crime and the Exiles cause it. I guess the government just wanted to check that I wasn't going to join the Exiles. Reasonable, there are only so many bank robberies a city can deal with. In other states and cities across the globe, they've been dealing well with the sudden rise in super-human abilities. My city, not so much.</p>

        It was a sunny Saturday afternoon when the council finally stopped calling me. I was watching TV and eating, desperately trying to ignore the sound of the phone when suddenly I realized that the phone was no longer ringing. It was only in my head for the last ten minutes.
             </p>

</p>
        <p>
            Releasing a sigh of relief, I melted into the couch and celebrated the ceasing of the ringing in my head. The silence was deafening in the best way.
             </p>
        <p>
            Until it was interrupted by the doorbell.
             </p>
        <p>
            I must admit, answering the door in my Donald Duck pajamas wasn't the best idea, especially when opening the door to two men and a woman in business attire. 
             </p>
        <p>
            "Hello, Miss Torkini. Is your phone broken?" The woman said. The bun in her hair was so tight, her eyebrows had been stretched upwards on her face.
             </p>
        <p>
            Straight up.
         </p>
        <p>
            "No. Would you like to come in?" I step to the side and watch as they file in, inspecting my house and turning up their noses. </p>
        <p>
            The first man was short and quite heavy, if you will. He had wide-spread, grey eyes and a small nose with pinched lips and thick brows. His hair was thin and wiry. The second man was tall and had browned skin. His eyes were small and dark, his nose and lips large. His hair was non-existent, his eyebrows thin with widely spaced, though not very frequent, hair. The woman was tall and thin, her afore-mentioned hair brown and unnaturally shiny. She had a long thin nose and pursed lips, her eyes were a watery green and framed with short, black lashes and plucked brows. </p>
        <p>
            They were scary in an alltogether sense. </p>
        <p>
            They took seats on my couch and I sat on the tattered arm chair across from them. The woman folded her legs and sat right at the edge of the couch as if scared the couch would give her some strange disease. </p>
        <p>
            "My name is Lyla Blackheart, to my left is James Fisher," she motions to the tall man, "and to my right is Doctor Olman. We are from the coucil-" </p>
        <p>
            "Figures," I interrupt. </p>
        <p>
            I see her stiffen and a brief look of annoyance crosses her face before she returns to her usual measure of composure. "As I was saying, we are from the council to talk to you about your recent," she clears her throat, "developments." She gestures to Doctor Olman and he shuffles, clearing his throat. </p>
        <p>
            "Now, Miss Torkini, becoming a Power is not something to take lightly, this will affect the rest of your life, and not always for the better. If you become an X, the Exiles will come after you, new blood and all. However, if you become an Exile, the Xs will come after you as well as the government. We would like to know if you've been exhibiting any signs of other powers. Have you?" I shrug. "Okay, we would like to perform a series of standard tests to see if you're developing any other abilities we should know of." </p>
        <p>
            "Do I have to? What if I just hide them like some other people. It doesn't matter, does it?"  </p>
        <p>
            "Actually," James interjects, "now that Macy Lynch's family knows, they are able to go to the press and release the fact that you are a Power. Supposing they know. Most teenage girls can't break an arm with a single punch, can they?" I shake my head. "So we want to know if you have any more so when the time comes that you do pick a side, you will be able to fight to the best of your ability." </p>
        <p>
            "What if I want to join the Exiles? You'll know all my tricks. You'll also be helping me to rob stuff." Lyla sighs. </p>
        <p>

            </p>
        <p>
            "We're hoping you don't go to the Exiles. Also, these tests are not for our benefit, they are solely for your own so you can make a sensible decision on what to do with these new abilities." I scoff and roll my eyes. Lyla glares at me. </p>
        <p>
            "Yeah, I believe that," I say with thick tones of sarcasm. "Listen, if I have more powers, I can figure them out on my own. If that's all, I'd like you to leave." I stand up, ignoring their icy looks. They rise and file to the exit, their goodbyes echoing through my empty house after they leave. </p>
        <p>
            I drop back onto the couch again and sigh.  </p>
        <p>
            Why did life have to be so complicated?
